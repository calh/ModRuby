Eight years before his death, when Pascal was 31, he had a divine experience
whereupon he could feel the presence of God. He jotted down his overwhelming
memories of this experience on a piece of leather, and sewed it into the lining
of his coat. He never liked to share the sanctity of the experience. Today we
know about it due to a note found by Pascal’s servant from his coat after his
death. It is interesting to know that he kept this note every time he wore his
coat. The note revealed that the event that occurred on November 23, 1654
completely changed Pascal’s life.

His Confession:

In the year of Grace, 1654, On Monday, 23rd of November, Feast of St.
Clement...From about half past ten in the evening until about half
past twelve,
Fire,
God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob,
not of the philosophers and scholars.
Certitude. Certitude. Feeling. Joy. Peace.
God of Jesus Christ
“Thy God shall be my God.”
Forgetfulness of the world and of everything,
except God.
He is to be found only by the ways taught in the
Gospel.
Greatness of the human soul.
“Righteous Father, the world hath not known
Thee, but I have known Thee.” [John 17 : 25]
Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy.
I have separated myself from Him
“My God, wilt Thou leave me ?”
Let me not be separated from Him eternally.
“This is the eternal life, that they might know Thee,
the only true God, and the one whom Thou hast
sent, Jesus Christ” [John 17 : 3]
Jesus Christ.
I have separated myself from Him : I have fled from
Him, denied Him, crucified Him.
Let me never be separated from Him.
We keep hold of Him only by the ways taught in the
Gospel.
Renunciation, total and sweet.
Total submission to Jesus Christ and to my director.
Eternally in joy for a day’s training on earth. Amen.
